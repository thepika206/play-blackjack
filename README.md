# Blackjack
- By Patrick Cheung 2022

## Background
- This is the Unit 1 project for General Assembly where we were tasked to individually create a web game.  Other choices included connect four, battleship, digital pet, choose your own adventure, snake, tetris, war and others... 
- I chose Blackjack as my game project because I've always enjoyed playing it in other video games, and it can be played with a little or a lot of free time.   I hoped to get creative with the game bonuses to make it more fun regardless of the player skill.
