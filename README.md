## Background
- I created a Blackjack game as an individual project for a coding camp at General Assembly
- Play it here https://thepika206-play-blackjack.netlify.app/
- See my original design and planning here in Whimsical https://whimsical.com/blackjack-planning-HpVFNvKGdZD6gHu6N8P7yz# Blackjack
- My favorite part of this project was designing the logic for the dual value of Aces

  
## Game Summary
- A game for one player based on the classic card game of 21
- The object is to be closer to 21 than the dealer (controlled by the CPU) without going over
- Ace logic for 1 or 11
- deck stats for card counting using Hi-Lo running count
- Two betting options
- Includes a bonus payout for drawing natural 21
- Special (doubledown) multiplier down
- Mobile layout (deck stats hidden)

- suggested moves based on your current total and the dealer up card
- variable bet
- insurance
