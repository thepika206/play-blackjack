# Blackjack
- By Patrick Cheung 2022
- Deployed with Netlify  https://thepika206-play-blackjack.netlify.app/
- based on the classic card game.  The player whose total is the closest to 21 without going over is the winner.
- split and double down not part of MVP

## Background
- Individual Project created during General Assembly bootcamp to create web games.  Other choices included connect four, battleship, digital pet, choose your own adventure, snake, tetris, war and others... 
- I chose Blackjack as my game project because I've always enjoyed playing it in other video games, and it can be played with a little or a lot of free time.   I hoped to get creative with the game bonuses to make it more fun regardless of the player skill.
