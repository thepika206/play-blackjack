## Background
- This is an Individual Project created during General Assembly bootcamp. 
- I chose Blackjack as my game project because I've always enjoyed playing it as a minigame within other video games such as Red Dead Redemption. It can be played with a little or a lot of free time.   
- planning this build was done in Whimsical.com
