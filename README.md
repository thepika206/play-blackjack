## Background
- This is the Unit 1 project for General Assembly to demonstrate proficiency with combining HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a simple web game.
- I chose to build Blackjack because it is a game that most every is familiar with, and although the rules seem simple at first glance, there were many details of game logic that made this enjoyable to model in code.  Soft and Hard values concerning Aces, Shuffling cards, Double Down.
